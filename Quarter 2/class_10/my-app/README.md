class 10 

in this class we integrated an Api in our code 
Api : https://simple-books-api.glitch.me/books

you can check out that how to use this Api from here : https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md

here we make a dynamic process to fetch data and just need to give the url of api 
and now we can use this api fetcher any where we want and give it any kind of fetch data.

As we fetched the data from that api which I mentioned above.
we render it on the page by applaying the map metod on the data provided by the api.
