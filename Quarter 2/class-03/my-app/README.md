in this class we do these things:

- first of all created a heading to showthat its a home page 
- then we created a about folder and a page.tsx file in it to make a route, we put "/about" after local host.
- "/about" was a long way so we make a simple navbar component and display it on layout.tsx so it can be visible on every page 
- then we learn about sub routes 
i made /products/proct01 and /products/proct02 

I made all this navigation through Link which I import from next.
