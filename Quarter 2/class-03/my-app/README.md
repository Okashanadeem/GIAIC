## Class 03 Overview

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Creating simple page navigation and routes in Next.js.
- Using the `Link` component for easy navigation.

### Steps Covered:
1. **Heading for Home Page:**
   - Added a basic heading to indicate that itâ€™s the home page.

2. **Creating an About Page:**
   - Created an `about` folder.
   - Added a `page.tsx` file within the folder to establish an `/about` route.
   - Accessed the About page by appending `/about` to the localhost URL.

3. **Building a Navigation Bar:**
   - To simplify navigation, created a `Navbar` component.
   - Displayed the `Navbar` component within the `layout.tsx` so that it appears on every page, allowing for seamless navigation.

4. **Working with Sub-Routes:**
   - Practiced creating sub-routes by adding `/products/proct01` and `/products/proct02`.

5. **Using the `Link` Component:**
   - All navigation between routes was handled through the `Link` component, imported from Next.js.

### Key Takeaway:
This class focused on implementing basic routing, building reusable components like a navbar, and organizing pages using sub-routes for efficient navigation within a Next.js project.
