### 6. Using Shadcn UI Components
Shadcn UI provides various prebuilt components that can be easily used in your project. Hereâ€™s how to use them:

#### Step 1: Import a Component
To use any component from Shadcn UI, start by importing it into your project:
```jsx
import { Accordion } from 'shadcn-ui';
```

#### Step 2: Installation of a Component
Install the component you need:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion
```

- If prompted to force an installation, select `force --` to override any conflicts.

#### Step 3: Setup the Component
Once installed, a new folder named `components` will be created. Inside this folder, you will find the imported component (e.g., `Accordion`).

- **Example**:
  Create a new folder in your project structure, named `myComponents`. In this folder, create a file named `Accordion.tsx`.
  
  In `Accordion.tsx`, paste the code provided by Shadcn UI:
  ```jsx
  import { Accordion } from 'shadcn-ui';
  
  const MyAccordion = () => (
    <Accordion>
      {/* Content goes here */}
    </Accordion>
  );
  
  export default MyAccordion;
  ```

- To change the content of the Accordion, modify the `Accordion.tsx` file in the `myComponents` folder.
- To change styling, make adjustments in the `components` folder created by Shadcn UI.

#### Step 4: Using the Component
To render the Accordion in your project:
```jsx
import MyAccordion from './components/myComponents/Accordion';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <MyAccordion />
  </div>
);
```
