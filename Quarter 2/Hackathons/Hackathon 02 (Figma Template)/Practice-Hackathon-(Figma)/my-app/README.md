# Ecommerce Pixel Perfect Practice Web Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of practice for a hackathon challenge. In this Figma practice project, we were tasked with creating a pixel-perfect web interface based on a provided practice Figma design. The Figma design served as the reference for creating a responsive e-commerce desktop website. The project matches the Figma layout and style as closely as possible.
