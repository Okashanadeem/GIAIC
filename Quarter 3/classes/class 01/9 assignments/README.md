# Class 1 - Quarter 3

## Overview
In **Class 1 of Quarter 3**, we covered fundamental Python concepts. You can find the detailed topics in the **parent repository of this folder**. This session focused on building a strong foundation in Python programming through practical applications and hands-on projects.

## Assigned Projects
As part of our learning, we were assigned **nine projects** to apply our knowledge and enhance our coding skills:

1. **Mad Libs** â€“ A fun word game where users fill in blanks to create a humorous story.
2. **Guess the Number (Computer)** â€“ The computer selects a number, and the user tries to guess it.
3. **Guess the Number (User)** â€“ The user thinks of a number, and the computer attempts to guess it.
4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** â€“ A simple Python game against the computer.
5. **Hangman** â€“ A word-guessing game with limited attempts.
6. **Countdown Timer** â€“ A Python script that counts down from a given time.
7. **Password Generator** â€“ A program that generates secure passwords.
8. **BMI Calculator (Streamlit)** â€“ A web app that calculates BMI in just six minutes.
9. **Build a Python Website (Streamlit)** â€“ Create a basic website in 15 minutes using Streamlit.

## Learning Outcome
These projects reinforce essential programming concepts such as:
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops and iterations
- Functions and modular programming
- User input and interaction
- Basic game logic and decision-making
- Web development with **Streamlit**

By completing these assignments, students gain hands-on experience with Python and develop practical problem-solving skills.
