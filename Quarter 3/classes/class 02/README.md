# Class 02 - Python Basics

## Introduction
In this class, we used **Jupyter Notebook** inside **VS Code** by saving our file with the `.ipynb` extension instead of `.py`. We explored various Python concepts, including string, list, and dictionary methods. Additionally, we were given homework to study **set** and **tuple** methods.

## Key Topics Covered
### 1. Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter Notebook allows us to execute code in separate cells.
- We can run each cell individually to check outputs without executing the entire script.
- It provides an interactive coding environment, making debugging easier.

### 2. String Methods
A **method** is a built-in function associated with an object that performs specific operations.
We explored various **string methods**:
- `upper()`: Converts the entire string to uppercase.
- `lower()`: Converts the entire string to lowercase.
- `capitalize()`: Capitalizes only the first letter.
- `title()`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word.
- `len()`: Returns the length of the string.
- `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing spaces.
- `lstrip()`: Removes leading spaces.
- `rstrip()`: Removes trailing spaces.
- `replace(old, new)`: Replaces occurrences of `old` with `new`.
- `find(char)`: Finds the index of a character, returns `-1` if not found.
- `index(char)`: Similar to `find()`, but raises an error if the character is not found.
- `startswith(substring)`: Checks if a string starts with a given substring.
- `endswith(substring)`: Checks if a string ends with a given substring.
- `split(separator)`: Splits a string into a list based on a separator.

### 3. List Methods
We explored various **list methods**:
- `append(item)`: Adds an item at the end of the list.
- `insert(index, item)`: Inserts an item at a specific index.
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the last item.
- `extend(list2)`: Merges two lists.
- `+` Operator: Another way to merge lists.
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
- `sort(reverse=True)`: Sorts the list in descending order.
- `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the list.
- `remove(item)`: Removes a specific item.
- `copy()`: Creates a copy of the list.
- **List Slicing**: Extracting parts of a list using `[start:end]` or `[start:end:step]`.

### 4. Dictionary Methods
A **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs. We covered the following methods:
- `update({key: value})`: Adds or updates a key-value pair.
- `pop(key)`: Removes a key and returns its value.
- `popitem()`: Removes and returns the last key-value pair.
- `keys()`: Returns all dictionary keys.
- `values()`: Returns all dictionary values.
- `items()`: Returns all key-value pairs as tuples.
- **Looping through dictionaries**:
  - Using `.items()` to iterate over key-value pairs.
  - Unpacking dictionary items into variables.

### 5. Homework: Set and Tuple Methods
We were assigned to research **set** and **tuple** methods as homework:
- **Set Methods**: Used for unique collections.
- **Tuple Methods**: Used for immutable sequences.

## Conclusion
This class provided a hands-on introduction to **Jupyter Notebook** and Python **methods**, particularly for **strings, lists, and dictionaries**. The homework encourages us to explore **set** and **tuple** methods for a more comprehensive understanding of Python collections.
