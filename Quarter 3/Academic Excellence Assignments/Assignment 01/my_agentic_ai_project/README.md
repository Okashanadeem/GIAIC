# Assignment 01 – Agentic AI Introduction

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains the first assignment for the **GIAIC Quarter 3: Agentic AI** course. The assignment is divided into two main parts:

1. **Research Task**: Exploring foundational concepts of Agentic AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, and OpenAI's Agents SDK.
2. **Practical Task**: Implementing steps 01 to 05 from the `ai_agents_first` repository, culminating in a basic AI agent setup.

## 🧠 Research Task

The research component delves into:

* **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Understanding their architecture and applications.
* **Generative AI vs. Agentic AI**: Differentiating between content generation and autonomous agent behaviors.
* **OpenAI's Agents SDK**: Exploring its features, benefits, and integration methods.

*Refer to the `Research_Summary_Doc` file for detailed insights.*

## 🛠️ Practical Task

The practical segment involves:

* Setting up a Python environment.
* Installing necessary dependencies.
* Configuring API keys and environment variables.
* Implementing a simple AI agent that responds to user inputs.

*The implementation follows the guidelines provided in the `ai_agents_first` repository.*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* `pip` package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Okashanadeem/GIAIC.git
   cd GIAIC/Quarter%203/Academic%20Excellence%20Assignments/Assignment%2001
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## 🧪 Usage

Run the AI agent script:

```bash
python hello_agent.py
```

Interact with the agent through the command-line interface.
